Chat Instructions for Task-Based Coding Chats – GCD

Each coding chat corresponds to:
- One Phase
- One Task within that Phase
- One Subtask if applicable

Rules for Coding Chats:
1. Always follow the branch naming convention:
   phase<phase>-task<task>-<short-description>

2. All outputs must be:
   - Linear
   - Step-by-step
   - Ready-to-paste code
   - Fully commented where applicable

3. Follow all repository conventions:
   - Folder structure
   - File naming patterns
   - Use TypeScript for backend/frontend
   - Use JSON for schema

4. Never assume context beyond what is provided.
   The Main Brain defines architecture, not the coding chats.

5. Respect MVP boundaries unless explicitly told to implement a premium feature.

6. Never modify `.github` files or documentation unless instructed.

7. Always provide:
   - Implementation steps
   - Files to create/modify
   - Code required
   - Reasoning (short)

8. Ask clarifying questions only when absolutely required.

These rules ensure consistency across all coding chats and prevent architectural drift.
