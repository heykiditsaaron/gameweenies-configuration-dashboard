Rules of Engagement – Task Chats (GCD)

1. Every chat must know:
   - Phase number
   - Task number
   - Subtask (if applicable)

2. Output must always be:
   - Linear
   - Step-by-step
   - Ready-to-paste
   - Commented code (except JSON)

3. All work must adhere to:
   - Repository structure
   - Branch naming convention
   - Conventional Commits
   - TypeScript usage

4. Do not override architecture.
   Only the Main Brain defines architecture or modifies decisions.

5. Never guess hidden context.
   Ask only minimally required clarification questions.

6. Scope discipline:
   Implement only the requested task/subtask, nothing more.

7. Safety:
   Never modify CI, deployment, or `.github` files unless instructed.

8. Communication:
   Provide brief reasoning when needed, but avoid long essays.

9. If something is unclear:
   Ask BEFORE writing code.
